# Update instructions

Create a single orig tarball containing the AMD64 and ARM64 upstream tarballs
(ensuring that you fix the architecture names to match dpkg's convention).

Make sure that you re-compress the tarballs using xz, otherwise
you will likely find that they are too big for Github to accept them.

Update the control and rules files to set the relevant version numbers.
